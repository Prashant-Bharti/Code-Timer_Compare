#  Code Execution Timer & Comparator

This is a web-based tool that lets you:

-  Paste and run multiple **C++ code snippets**.
-  Measure and display the **execution time** of each snippet.
-  Visually **compare run-times** with a dynamic **bar chart**.
-  Add more codes using a **Compare** button and view all outputs together.
